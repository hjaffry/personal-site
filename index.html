  <p>I'm trying to prevent a hair-on-fire problem from happening, even though my ICP doesn't yet believe their hair will be on fire.</p>
  <p>Co-Founder @ <a href="#">Dina AI</a>.</p> <p>AI CFO for the Private Markets.</a>.</p>
  <p>Finance & Economics @ University of Toronto. Prev. @ <a href="zeed.ai">Zeed.<p>
  <p>I believe everything happens by God's wills, but we mistake it for our doing, so we get fooled by randomness. And I love Turkish shawarma.</p>
  <p>
    People ask me who my favourite founder is. I say 
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lomqcrFNv8">Chris Hladczuk</a>
    (website inspired by <a href="https://chrishlad.com/">him</a>).

  <p>Interesting Stuff About Me:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Stopped playing video games when I was 10. Have never played since (I'm 19).</p>
    <li><p>Grew up w/o a phone. I got my first at 17 only because I was going to university.</p>
    <li><p>Fast tracked high school two years early, took a year off to work in non-profit. Helped me pay my uni tuition.</p>
    <li><p>Came first place in a provincial public speaking championship. Parents are still very proud of me.</p>
